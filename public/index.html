        This thing is the easiest thing ever, without having to rely on AI slop. I don't understand how people cannot
        grasp the fact that this is easy af and that we, the old school software engineers, are not going to be replaced
        by a robot just because they type faster than us. The things literally cannot think for themselves and create
        things out of nothing, because it feeds on human intellect.
        I don't think this is really the way, I think that this is just a stupid bubble, just like the NFTs bullshit
        back in 2021. Let's get serious for a second and think things through, unless ChatGippity does the thinking for
        you too.

        good thing for us in the long run.</p>
